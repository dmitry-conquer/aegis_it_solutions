                        When we talk with different organizations, invariably the conversation at some point comes to
                        what they are being recommended for switches, firewalls, access points, etc. Most of the time we
                        are being asked to provide our opinion from a cybersecurity perspective and from a business
                        perspective. The more I think about these conversations, the less I understand why smaller
                        companies that outsource their IT services are buying these.
